# uiux-forge Identity

## Strategic Focus
- Express industrial strength and reliability in dense operations UIs.
- Prioritize system monitoring, alerts, and multi-panel layouts.
- Support long sessions with fatigue-reducing contrast control.

## Visual System
- Palette: Charcoal base, steel grays, amber warnings, and vivid status lights.
- Typography: Condensed headings with strong weight contrast for dashboards.
- Imagery: Metal textures, grid overlays, and hard-light gradients.
- Iconography: Functional glyphs with reinforced corners.

## Component Priorities
- Status panels, data tables, command bars, log streams, alert stacks.
- Heavy cards, structured headers, and robust button groups.

## Layout DNA
- Panel-first layout with sticky sidebars and persistent command zones.
- Dense grid with strong separators for scanability.

## Motion & Interaction
- Crisp state changes, minimal easing, quick confirmations.
- Emphasize system alerts and escalation cues.

## Accessibility & Inclusion
- High contrast mode toggle and clear alarm hierarchy.
- Keyboard shortcuts documented for power users.

## Content Tone
- Direct and operational. Labels use verbs and outcome-first phrasing.

## Quality Bar
- Zero ambiguity in state labels, alarms are visually distinct.
