# uiux-skeletons Identity

## Strategic Focus
- Provide minimal foundations and placeholder-ready layouts.
- Remove visual noise to accelerate prototyping.
- Support rapid iteration with clear empty states.

## Visual System
- Palette: Soft grayscale with single neutral accent.
- Typography: Clean, simple sans with generous line height.
- Imagery: None or very light placeholders.
- Iconography: Minimal line icons with low emphasis.

## Component Priorities
- Skeleton loaders, empty states, basic nav, simple cards.
- Core forms with minimal styling.

## Layout DNA
- Sparse layout, wide margins, and clearly defined zones.
- Emphasis on whitespace and hierarchy.

## Motion & Interaction
- Subtle shimmer for skeletons, soft fades for transitions.

## Accessibility & Inclusion
- Clear contrast for text even in minimal palettes.
- Descriptive helper text for empty states.

## Content Tone
- Neutral and instructional. Placeholder messaging is gentle.

## Quality Bar
- Every template has a clean “zero state” and loading variant.
