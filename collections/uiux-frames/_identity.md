# uiux-frames Identity

## Strategic Focus
- Deliver reusable layout frames for multiple content types.
- Separate structure from content for flexible re-skinning.
- Prioritize responsive layout integrity.

## Visual System
- Palette: Neutral frames with soft shadow separation.
- Typography: System sans for neutrality.
- Imagery: Placeholder blocks and wireframe hints.
- Iconography: Simple container and layout markers.

## Component Priorities
- Frame containers, headers, sidebars, footers, split panes.
- Slot-based cards and grid regions.

## Layout DNA
- Strong layout scaffolding with consistent gutters and rails.
- Slots follow predictable ratios (1/3, 2/3, 1/4).

## Motion & Interaction
- Gentle layout transitions for responsive shifts.
- Keep motion purely structural.

## Accessibility & Inclusion
- Clear landmarks for screen readers and skip links.
- Visual separators don't rely on color alone.

## Content Tone
- Structural and instructive. Emphasize placement.

## Quality Bar
- Frames remain intact across breakpoints and content lengths.
