# uiux-craft Identity

## Strategic Focus
- Anchor the default system with balanced, product-ready decisions.
- Support multiple product types without visual drift.
- Keep performance, clarity, and accessibility as baseline constraints.

## Visual System
- Palette: Neutral base with confident indigo accents and soft success greens.
- Typography: Practical sans stack with clear hierarchy and legible numerals.
- Imagery: Minimal gradients, quiet textures, and subtle depth.
- Iconography: Simple line icons with consistent stroke weight.

## Component Priorities
- Login, Dashboard, navigation, cards, filters, tables, modals, toasts.
- Reusable chips, badges, and state indicators for system status.

## Layout DNA
- 12-column responsive grid, generous gutters, and predictable spacing scale.
- Balanced density: readable in data-heavy contexts without clutter.

## Motion & Interaction
- Micro-transitions at 120–180ms, easing out for clarity.
- Emphasis on feedback (hover, focus, loading, success states).

## Accessibility & Inclusion
- AA contrast as default, clear focus rings, and keyboard-first navigation.
- Copywriting avoids jargon and includes state-specific helper text.

## Content Tone
- Clear, confident, calm. Short verbs and explicit CTAs.

## Quality Bar
- 1-click theming, consistent spacing tokens, and predictable component states.
